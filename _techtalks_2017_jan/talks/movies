title: Virtual Reality and the cinematic future
presenter: Den Fynske Spilfabrik/The Danish Game Factory
description: "Film has been through an amazing journey. Now the film making industry stands before an epic transformation, as Virtual Reality is breaking through to the consumer market.  
Here again, film tempts with its multidimensional experiences and gives opportunities, not only for us to touch the characters in the movies, but also for us to experience the characters touching us.
The reason why Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality is especially exciting for the future of moviemaking, is that the bodily technological possibilities is on whole new grounds for movie making and game production.  
There are many new exciting challenges associated with finding unexplored ways to create new types of narratives. What do we do about interaction and the movie flow? What about the seersâ€™ visual focus? How do we handle close emotional scenes? 
Nonetheless, within a couple of years, film and Virtual Reality will find a common ground and our view of reality will never be the same again."
