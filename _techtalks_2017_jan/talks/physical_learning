title: Virtual Reality: The bodily learning and applied games
presenter: Den Fynske Spilfabrik/The Danish Game Factory
description: "In Virtual Reality, the body gets drawn into the universe as the physical experiencer. This gives new opportunities for training games and learning games.
To dive deeper into the possibilities of exploiting these bodily learnings, we will first talk about what applied games are and what they can do. Where do we intercept these different genres of applied games in our everyday lives?
Hereafter, we will reflect on the future of games, which can potentially change how we follow our life goals. These types of games combine machine learning; our digital footprint and the search for a happy life. 
But how long do we dare to go, before our life hacking has ethical consequences from the extended immersions of our minds?"
