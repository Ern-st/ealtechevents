time: "17:10"
presenter: Mikkel Toppel Andersen
description: "There has been radical development in the use of 3D digital building models in the building design and construction industry over the past few years.  Incorporating aspects of the buildings life cycle, 3D modelling has become a central driver in the building process â€“ from initial concept through to demolition and disposal. <br />The talk provides a guided tour in the use of 3D digital media throughout the process and considers what the future may bring."
