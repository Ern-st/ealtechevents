Welcome to the site. Here we collect the information related to EAL hackathon.

What is this?
---------------

We are doing a hackathon at EAL in Odense on the weekend the May 20th to 22nd 2016.

This is repeat of the succesfull hackathon in November, and we are planning a series of tech events in the future. Now, we even have an EAL tech event group set up.

What's in it for me?
-----------------------

* Meet like minded people that you don't see everyday
* Get cred for your cool project
* Break mental walls, and get inspired
* Learn something new

Who should come?
--------------------

* Everybody with an geeky interest in IT
* Programmers, electronics devs, sysÂ­admins, networkadmins, senior/junior/noobs


I want to come, now what?
