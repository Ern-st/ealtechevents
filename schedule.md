We are currently working on getting talks and workshops planned, so expect these tables to be updated.

Do you have something you want to share?

* Do a talk: 15-30 minutes about your favorite topic
* Do a workshop: 1+ hours where you enlighten everybody about how to do something you find interesting and/or useful.
