Daxiomatic is bringing AI to ERP (Niels Kodal)

Get all this questions answered and ask your own.


The methods of Artificial Intelligence (Adam Czerwinski)
--------------------------------------
 
Ever wondered what an artificial neural network is or what machine learning really learns. This talk will go through the concepts of the various AI techniques used and show some usage of such. 


Communication as a Profesional (Simon Glashoff)
---------------------------------

This talk will introduce why communication is important, while we will focus on how to think about communication as a professional on an abstract level. We will look at examples throughout the talk to give contexts and real life examples of how communication is either supporting a project goal or ruining the project all together.


Let's collaborate - a pitch for everyone to use github (Morten Bo Nielsen)
----------------------------------------------

Version control is the way to go, and using a collaborative platform like github is even better.

I will try to convince you to use github if you are a programmer, and at least consider it if you are everbody else.


Coding across the platforms with Xamarin (Benjamin Lærkegaard)
--------------------------------------------

Why focus on a platform when you can focus on the code? In this talk Xamarin will be introduced and we will look at the reasons why this framework has become hugely popular with many developers.
