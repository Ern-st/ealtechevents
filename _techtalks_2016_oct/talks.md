Communication as a Profesional (Simon Glashoff)
---------------------------------

This talk will introduce why communication is important, while we will focus on how to think about communication as a professional on an abstract level. We will look at examples throughout the talk to give contexts and real life examples of how communication is either supporting a project goal or ruining the project all together.


The methods of Artificial Intelligence (Adam Czerwinski)
