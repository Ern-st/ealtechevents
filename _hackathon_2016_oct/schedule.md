Proposed projects
============

DIY Wearable Pollution Detector (Steffen Mogensen)
---------------------------------------------------

The project is an IoT (Internet of things) solution, where you with an arduino, a gas sensor, a bluetooth module and a smartphone is capable of registering air pollution, at any given location..
The idea is to have the arduino to use the gas sensor to detect the polution level and, using bluetooth, send the information to the smartphone, which in turn uses its GPS for localisation.
You can then either send this information to a REASTful API in the cloud, or show it locally on a map. The first solution would be the coolest given the mulituser perspective.

The project will probably include some of the follwoing

  * C-programming (Arduino)
  * Some soldering
  * Java/Android programming
  * 3D print of cabinet
  * optionally developping a RESTful service.
