IT and ethics (Lise Agerbæk)
------------------------------

The Dutch philosopher Peter Paul Verbeek has written a book about how the “things” we surround ourselves with, change the conditions of our understanding and our possibilities for actions. “Things” are in his understanding anything from a table to a tablet, from a door to a device.

The design of “things” enable some experiences, but they also prevent others. This has ethical consequences for human beings as well as furthering/hindering the acquisition of knowledge. And it has impact on what designers should think about when they bring things into the world.

Artificial Intelligence in a nutshell and beyond… (Adam Czerwinski)
--------------------------

Have you ever heard the words artificial intelligence and wondered what they mean and how it all works? Or are you just curious about how the future could look?

Then join this Tech Talk as we will cover the basic concepts of AI, how and where it is used in our everyday life and how AI has become such a field of interest over the last years.  

The anatomy of a website (Erik Weber-Lauridsen)
-------------------------

We all use the web, and many of us have heard of something called HTML, but how a modern website actually built? How does the design choices reflect in the code? Are the structure and design today different than 15 years ago? Where are websites going?

The talk will be about how a modern website is built, the most used languages will be introduced and different design trends will be examined.


Virtualisation with Virtualbox (Ruben Sternke)
-----------------------------

Do you want to try a new operating system, but don't have the extra computer hardware it may require?

How about a trip down memory lane, by playing one of Your old 90's PC game - but unfortunately the game can't be played directly on your new fancy Windows 10 machine with gigs of memory and lots of GHz?

Do you visit web pages you don't trust due to viruses and other nasty things - and are a little afraid of getting your laptop infected or even hacked?

This talk will introduce You to virtualization by using the free and open source project called VirtualBox. During the talk will you be introduced to:

* How and when to use virtualization.
* How easy it is to setup and install a new operating system in VirtualBox.
* How easy it is to run different operating systems simultaneously on a Windows 7 laptop.
* How easy it is to make snapshots of a running operating system - which is useful if the system gets infected by viruses or hacks.
* How to interact with an installed virtual operating system from the host PC.

There will be hands-on help for installing and configuring VirtualBox after the talks.





Why Linux? (Jonas Holm)
---------------------------------

Linux has become an ever expanding operating system, used in almost every IT system today. But what makes Linux such a powerful tool and operating system? Why choose Linux instead of e.g. Windows? How to get started with Linux…? Find out by attending the Tech Talk followed by a workshop about Linux usage!

To be used for the workshop:

* a telnet/SSH client, e.g [putty](http://www.putty.org/) or similar
* for exercises: http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/
