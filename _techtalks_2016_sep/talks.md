The anatomy of a website (Erik Weber-Lauridsen)
-------------------------

We all use the web, and many of us have heard of something called HTML, but how a modern website actually built? How does the design choices reflect in the code? Are the structure and design today different than 15 years ago? Where are websites going?

The talk will be about how a modern website is built, the most used languages will be introduced and different design trends will be examined.
